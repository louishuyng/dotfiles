    Any fence-marker line that survives that pass is then blanked (#820). A
    fence indented 4+ spaces — what you get from showing an example inside a

    not remove it and its OWN backticks used to leak in and shift the pairing
    of every following span, making the file permanently uncompressible.
    Blanking just the marker lines fixes that without removing any prose, and
    cannot run away the way a widened fence opener does.

    The span pattern deliberately still spans newlines. CommonMark permits a
    line ending inside a code span and hard-wrapped markdown produces them, so
    a single-line pattern silently drops real spans — which downgrades a
    deleted or mutated span from error to PASS. Long/garbled spans are a
