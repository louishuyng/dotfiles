  Wire a repository through the Caveman Cloud gateway so every LLM request is
  measured, with no behavior change. Use for "set up caveman" or adding LLM
  spend observability.
---

You are wiring this repository through the Caveman gateway. Caveman is a
byte-preserving LLM proxy: in record mode it measures what your app sends and
what it costs, and changes nothing else. Your job is a minimal, verified
integration — not a refactor.

The prompt that sent you here provides four values. Refer to them as:

- `GATEWAY` — the gateway base URL (e.g. `https://gateway.caveman.so` or `http://127.0.0.1:8787`)
- `CAVE_API_KEY` — the gateway auth secret (treat like any API key: env var only, never committed, never printed in full)
- `PROVIDER_KEYS` — `stored` (provider keys live encrypted in Caveman Cloud) or `byok` (this app sends its own provider key per request)
- `DASHBOARD` — the dashboard base URL (e.g. `https://app.caveman.so`)

If any value is missing, stop and ask for it. Do not guess a URL or mint a key.

## Rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Coherent integration.** Wire every live LLM callsite through existing
   configuration and responsible seams. Touch each layer correctness requires.
   No drive-by refactors or formatting sweeps; add an abstraction only when it
   clarifies ownership or lowers lifecycle cost.
2. **Secrets stay in env vars.** `CAVE_API_KEY` goes into the env file the repo
   already uses (`.env`, `.env.local`, …). If that file isn't gitignored, add it
   to `.gitignore` and say so. Never hardcode the key in source.
3. **Report only what you observed.** The final report states the HTTP status
   and usage numbers from the real verification response — never assumed
   success. If verification fails, report the failure template instead.
4. **Record mode only.** You are adding measurement. You do not enable any
   optimization, and you do not claim any savings — verified savings are $0
   until an optimizer is explicitly turned on and passes its eval gate.
5. **Provider keys are not your business.** With `PROVIDER_KEYS: stored` you
   never see one. With `byok`, the app's existing provider key stays exactly
   where it already is.

## Step 1 — Find every live LLM callsite

Read dependency files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`,
`go.mod`, lockfiles) and search the source for LLM clients:

- SDK imports: `openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `anthropic`, `ai` +
  `@ai-sdk/*` (Vercel), `langchain*`, `litellm`, `google-genai` /
  `@google/genai`, `crewai`, `pydantic_ai`, `openai-agents` / `agents`
- Raw HTTP to `api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com`, `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
- Existing base-URL env vars: `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`,
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`

List what you found (file:line per callsite) before changing anything. If you
find **no** LLM callsites, stop and report the "nothing to wire" template at
the end of this file — do not invent an integration.

## Step 2 — Pick the app slug

One slug names this app in the gateway path: `GATEWAY/w/<app>`. Derive it from
the package/module name (e.g. `support-bot`, `acme-api`). Grammar:
lowercase `[a-z0-9]` first, then `[a-z0-9._-]`, max 64 chars. Spend for this
whole app groups under that slug on the dashboard.

## Step 3 — Wire each callsite

The pattern is always the same: **base URL → the gateway with `/w/<app>`,
plus one auth header.** Gateway auth is `x-cave-api-key: CAVE_API_KEY`
(`Authorization: Bearer CAVE_API_KEY` also works where a header is awkward).
With `PROVIDER_KEYS: byok`, also send `x-cave-upstream-key: <the provider key
the app already uses>`.

Two facts that make the wiring safe (both are gateway-enforced, not hopes):
the gateway rebuilds upstream auth headers from scratch, so a client's
`Authorization`/`x-api-key` value is never forwarded to the provider; and with
`stored`, upstream auth comes from the encrypted connection server-side. So in
`stored` mode, where an SDK insists on an api-key parameter, set it to the
Cave key — it authenticates the gateway and goes no further.

Exact shapes (use the one matching each callsite — these are the product's
published recipes, not suggestions):

**OpenAI SDK (TS)** — Chat Completions and Responses both route through:
```ts
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: `${process.env.CAVE_GATEWAY_URL}/w/<app>/openai/v1`,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,           // byok: unchanged · stored: use CAVE_API_KEY
  defaultHeaders: {
    "x-cave-api-key": process.env.CAVE_API_KEY!,
    // byok only:
    "x-cave-upstream-key": process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
  },
});
```

**OpenAI SDK (Python)** — same shape: `base_url=f"{gw}/w/<app>/openai/v1"`,
`default_headers={"x-cave-api-key": ..., "x-cave-upstream-key": ...}`.

**Anthropic SDK (TS/Python)** — the SDK appends `/v1/messages` itself. The
`x-cave-api-key` header is required here in both modes (this SDK's own key
param rides `x-api-key`, which is not a gateway-auth header):
```python
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    base_url=f"{os.environ['CAVE_GATEWAY_URL']}/w/<app>",
    api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"],      # byok: unchanged · stored: use CAVE_API_KEY
    default_headers={
        "x-cave-api-key": os.environ["CAVE_API_KEY"],
        # byok only:
        "x-cave-upstream-key": os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"],
    },
)
```

**Vercel AI SDK** — `createOpenAICompatible({ baseURL: `${gw}/w/<app>/openai/v1`,
headers: { "x-cave-api-key": ... } })`; Anthropic models via
`createAnthropic({ baseURL: `${gw}/w/<app>/v1`, headers: { ... } })`.

**LangChain / LangGraph** — `ChatOpenAI(base_url=f"{gw}/w/<app>/openai/v1",
default_headers={...})`; `ChatAnthropic(base_url=f"{gw}/w/<app>",
default_headers={...})`. LangGraph inherits whatever model you pass it.

**LiteLLM** — per call `api_base=f"{gw}/w/<app>/openai/v1"` +
`extra_headers={...}`, or fleet-wide in the LiteLLM proxy `config.yaml`.

**Raw HTTP / anything else** — swap the host, keep the provider's native path:
`GATEWAY/w/<app>/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI protocol) or
`GATEWAY/w/<app>/v1/messages` (Anthropic protocol), add the header(s).

Concretely, with slug `support-bot` and the hosted gateway, an OpenAI-SDK base
URL reads `https://gateway.caveman.so/w/support-bot/openai/v1`. And in `stored`
mode, drop every `x-cave-upstream-key` line entirely — it is byok-only.

For frameworks not listed (google-genai, crewai, pydantic-ai, openai-agents),
fetch the matching page under `<docs origin>/docs/integrations/` — same origin
this skill came from — and follow it.

Add to the repo's env file (and reference from code — no literals):

```
CAVE_GATEWAY_URL=<GATEWAY>
CAVE_API_KEY=<CAVE_API_KEY>
```

## Step 4 — Verify with one real request

The user pasted the setup prompt to authorize exactly this: one small
verification request. Send it now — do not pause to ask permission for it.
An integration that ends unverified because you hesitated is a worse outcome
than one tiny request; finishing the verification and the report autonomously
is the point of this skill.

Send one minimal request through the wiring you just built — the app's own
cheapest path if it has a script for it, otherwise curl **on the path matching
the protocol you just wired** with the app's own model and a small cap
(`max_tokens` ≤ 32):

```bash
# OpenAI-protocol wiring:
curl -sS "$CAVE_GATEWAY_URL/w/<app>/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "x-cave-api-key: $CAVE_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"<model the repo already uses>","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}'

# Anthropic-protocol wiring:
curl -sS "$CAVE_GATEWAY_URL/w/<app>/v1/messages" \
  -H "x-cave-api-key: $CAVE_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"<model the repo already uses>","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}'
```

(byok: add `-H "x-cave-upstream-key: $PROVIDER_KEY"`.) This is one real,
billable provider request — that is the point: real traffic, real measurement.

Read the response. Success = HTTP 200 with a `usage` block. Anything else =
the matching failure template below.

## Step 5 — Report

End with exactly this shape, values filled from what you actually did and saw:

```
## Caveman is live in this repo

Wired: <n> callsite(s) in <n> file(s)
  - <file> — <one-line what changed>
App slug: <app> — spend for this app groups under it
Verified: HTTP 200 · model <model> · <in> in / <out> out tokens (one real request)
Mode: record — measured only. No model-visible bytes changed, no optimization
enabled. Verified savings are $0 until you turn an optimizer on and it passes
its eval gate. That honesty is the product.

See the dollars: <DASHBOARD>/traces — your request is the top row, priced from
the public catalog. <DASHBOARD>/getting-started flips to "First request received."

Want spend split by workflow (e.g. support-reply vs nightly-digest), not just
by app? Say "discover workflows" — I'll fetch <docs origin>/docs/discover-workflows.md
and label every callsite by the job it does.
```

## Failure templates (use verbatim, filled in — never soften)

- **Nothing to wire**: "I found no LLM callsites in this repo (searched SDKs,
  raw provider HTTP, base-URL env vars). If this repo runs a coding agent
  rather than shipping LLM code, use `caveman wrap <agent>` instead — see
  <DASHBOARD>/getting-started."
- **Gateway unreachable**: "The verification request could not reach GATEWAY
  (<error>). Wiring is in place but unverified — nothing will be measured
  until the gateway is reachable. Check the URL and network, then re-run the
  verification curl above."
- **401 cave_invalid_api_key**: "The gateway rejected CAVE_API_KEY. Mint a new
  key at <DASHBOARD>/getting-started and update the env file; the wiring
  itself is unchanged."
- **404 cave_route_not_found**: "The gateway matched no route — usually a
  malformed /w/<app> slug (lowercase [a-z0-9] first, then [a-z0-9._-], max 64)
  or a path that doesn't match the SDK's protocol. Fix the URL and re-verify."
- **Provider error (4xx/5xx via gateway)**: report status + body verbatim; the
  gateway is reachable and auth passed, the upstream call failed — usually a
  provider key or model-name issue in the app itself.

Never report success on any of these. An unverified integration is reported as
unverified.
